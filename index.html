    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      In our research project, we examined how migration has affected the formation and understanding of Australian culture. Especially since the post-WW2 period, Australia has seen many waves of immigrations, who, in each of their own ways, have contributed to how Australian culture has manifested and been perceived in the modern post-White Australia era. We each have examined different groups of immigrants in different parts of Victoria, exploring where migrant culture is visible in Modern Melbourne. (I wrote this intro in 2 minutes, it's not very good, please someone else write something better)

<h4><b>The culture of the Hillside Sharks Football Club</b></h4>
<p>
Shown is an image of the Hillside Sharks football club, a ground that comes alive with activity most afternoons; without a doubt every weekend. Through observation, I have found that this local landmark serves as a very simple snapshot of Australia’s cultural landscape, synthesising the ideas of colonialism and migration whilst also creating a lighthearted display of community. 
</p>
<h5><i>The History of Multiculturalism in Football</i></h5>
<p>
The National Museum of Australia describes football to have originated in the 19th century from Gaelic football and an Aboriginal game known as Marngrook, however is most heavily believed to originate from the football played in English private schools. This provides a succinct overview of the English influence on Australian culture, in the light of preexisting and introduced cultures in the country
</p>
<p>
A monumental example of the prominence of racial bias in Australian football is the iconic stand made at the Collingwood vs St Kilda 1993 match. At the time, racial abuse was commonplace on the grounds, not to mention the deep-seated racism and discrimination present against Indigenous Australians. Depicted is First Nations individual Nicky Winmar, standing before the opposition whilst pointing at his skin and declaring “I’m black, and I'm proud to be black.” In proclaiming this, Winmar confronts immediate, and historically interwoven racial prejudices placed on him and multiple First Nations members of the AFL. Lift of the jersey reveals the true self and in an approximate manner, also symbolises the imperative need to abolish colonialist views in assessing the significance of First Peoples values in multicultural Australia.
</p>
<p>
At a professional level the AFL remains overrun with Anglophone racial bias. Though slight progress has been made since 2014 with the introduction of international players, only 18 of its current player base identifies as international, either being born overseas themselves or having at least one parent born overseas.
</p>
<h5><i>At a local level</i></h5>
<p>
In observing the local ethnic composition not only of the teams who play football on the ground, but the numerous groups who make use of the space for other activities (cricket, loitering, etc), a largely diverse cultural profile may be observed. The interactions the players have, all coming from diverse cultural backgrounds, shapes the cultural landscape of the ground, which can extend to the landscape of the suburb. The intermingling of parents across ethnic backgrounds does transcend cultural boundaries, and creates an excellent mixed and accepting community.
</p>
<p>
However, one must not overlook how coming together like this stands as a prime example of the solemn loss of cultural identity, as at least partially the individuals do lean into colonialist ideologies and in a way, partaking in this game evokes a feeling of irony. To a certain extent, this does symbolise a loss of cultural values under colonialism. The creation of a local community, albeit wholesome, has added another layer of distance between the First Nations Peoples and their relationship with the land. Reclaiming this bond is now hindered by a seemingly virtuous idea of a multiculturalist landscape that, in actuality, catalyses white ownership of the land. 
</p>
<h4><b>A Reflective Review on Cultural Identity between Cultures in Hillside</b></h4>
<p>
My cultural identity as a third-generation individual is awkward, I am recognized by Aussies as not-quite Australian and by my Nanniet, not quite Maltese. I don’t speak Maltese other than a few words (the bad ones and “come here”,) and my closest brush with Australian culture is the Bunnings sausage sizzle.
</p>
<p>
As Shoemaker (1984) suggests, the idea of cultural identity is near incomprehensible, due to its inherent dynamic, multifaceted, unstable and emotionally charged nature. Despite this, setting oneself apart from others through identification of distinctive qualities remains indispensable, since it allows for one to maintain a sense of belonging.
</p>
<p>
Hillside, a suburb in Melbourne’s west, bears no distinct cultural identity at surface level, native trees and coloured bins dotting the curbs. Though the architectural features of the home are something to be noted on. Established in 2001, the area houses many second-generation individuals, capturing their cultural values in the construction of their homes. A stroll in the neighbourhood will allow for the observation of a European touch - columns and arches adorn most of the homes here (even a couple of elaborate angel statues and an olive tree). Migration to Australia has caused the literal landscape of the suburb to change. Culturally, the street visuals stand as a wonderful collage of diversity, the direct product of migration.
</p>
<p>
I know little of my cultural practices other than a dessert dish made during Easter, something I have watched my Nanna bake as a child, invited over to help with the decorating parts. Despite this, the recipe I was taught allows for a specific connection to culture to be made. Migration to Australia has brought significance to cultural dishes, now important in keeping tradition and culture alive. The cultural landscape of Australia is complex, and is composed of layers of culture, maintaining culturally specific practices is a way that migration has influenced its composition. 
</p>
<p>
Although studies on cultural conservation do conflict, such as in “Growing up Between Cultures: Linguistic and Cultural Identity Among Maltese and Their Ethnic Counterparts in Australia'', where Joe Grixti concludes that Maltese individuals are quick to lose their mother tongue whilst Waitt et al. insists that Maltese migrants ``[do] not attempt to shed [their] cultural heritage, despite prominent assimilationist policies'', current landscapes in migrant-populated areas create a multifaceted display of cultural persistence. Celebration of culture through material and non- material means such as spoken recipes, albeit few, create hybrid identities for those living in Australia as a product of migration. Culture has migrated with the people, and hence does not reside in a place, it is brought with and cultivated within one's community. So although the third-generation cultural dilemma is still up for debate, one cannot conclude that colonialist ideologies will remove the significance migration has had on communal composition.
